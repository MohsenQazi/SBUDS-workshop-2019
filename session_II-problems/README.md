## Session II-Galaxy Zoo 2:

**Galaxy Zoo**[^1] project was created to use the manpower on the Internet to clssify huge data which is provided by **SDSS** survey. The project has been started in 2007 and volunteers were asked to sort galaxy images as either elliptical, spiral, or mergers. In 2009, **Galaxy Zoo 2** provide a more detailed classification to look at galaxy characteristics like the presence of a bar, the tightness of the arms in spiral galaxies and the roundness of ellipticals. Here we try to use convolutioanl neural networks (CNN) to make a classification model.
